# Flow Optimizer

This project is a flow optimizer that uses FastAPI to create a web API, along with libraries like scikit-learn, networkx, and ortools to solve optimization problems.

## Technologies Used

- **FastAPI**: A framework for building fast and efficient APIs.
- **Uvicorn**: An ASGI server to run the FastAPI application.
- **Scikit-learn**: A library for machine learning.
- **NetworkX**: A library for the creation, manipulation, and study of complex networks.
- **OR-Tools**: A set of optimization tools from Google.

## Installation

To install the project dependencies, run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the Application

To start the server, use the following command:

```bash
uvicorn src.backend.main:app --reload
```
